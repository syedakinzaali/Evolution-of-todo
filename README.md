🚀 The Evolution of Todo: From Logic to Cloud-Native AI
By Syeda Kiza Ali | GIAIC/Panaversity Hackathon II

This project isn't just a "Todo app"—it is a case study in Spec-Driven Development. Over five phases, I evolved a simple Python script into a sophisticated, agentic system. I shifted my role from a "syntax writer" to a System Architect, leading AI agents to build a production-grade application

🏗️ My Architectural Journey:

Phase 1: The Basics (Python Console)
I started with a simple Python script. The challenge? I couldn't write the code myself. I had to learn how to write a "Spec" (a set of instructions) that was so clear even an AI couldn't mess it up.

Phase 2: Going Web (FastAPI & Next.js)
I turned that script into a real website.
Frontend: Next.js (The face).
Backend: FastAPI (The brain).
Database: Neon PostgreSQL (The memory).
Reality Check: Dealing with JWT tokens and user login was the first big hurdle.


Phase 3: Adding the Chatbot (The Cool Part)
This is where it stopped being a normal app. I added an AI agent that lets me manage my life through a chat box.
Natural Language: I can just tell the bot what to do, and it calls the database "tools" for me.
Architecture: Even though the terminal was full of red lines at times, the final logic is solid and stateless.


Phase 4 & 5: The Future (Kubernetes & Beyond)
I’m moving this into Kubernetes next.
The Goal: Put the app in a "Docker container" so it can run anywhere.
The Tech: Using Helm charts to manage the cluster and Kafka for future event-driven features.

🧠 What I Actually Learned
Coding with AI isn't about knowing every bracket or semicolon; it’s about Architecture. If you have a bad plan, you get bad code. I learned how to be the "Product Architect" who keeps the big picture in mind while the AI handles the boilerplate.
